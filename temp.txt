We are currently thinking about our action plan for this quarter:

Broadly, we want to:
- support for other platform starting with LinkinIn, X
- support for "quality" short form video generation with the help of Athena team's pipeline.

Additionally, we want to:
- do competitor analysis, which other platform are doing similar things
    - checkout features which are not supported by us and add them.
    - compare quality and if they are better, then how they are better.

Regarding deliverables for today:
- we will integrate social surge with LinkedIn or X
- competitor analysis for our platform with the mentioned details
